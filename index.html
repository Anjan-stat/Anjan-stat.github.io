							<p>
								I look for sustainable solutions within existing constraints. Industry experience across time and business domains has helped me to identify the bigger goal while keeping track of details. 
								
								</b><br>Currently, I’m a PhD candidate in Statistics working with volumetric data under the Bayesian framework. My work has a wider application in the generalized structure of directional coherence, a particular instance being neurological connections within the brain. 
								My technical expertise includes Bayesian analysis, Markdown sales forecasting, Market Mix Modelling, Count data modelling. I have implemented the aforementioned projects in R, SAS and Python. Specific fields of interest include simplex sampling, image analysis, directional data analysis, promotional modelling. I have two years of teaching experience in college-level Statistics and Mathematics with an application in R and SAS. 
								
								</b><br>While I am not crunching data, I prefer to spend time with my family.

								<b>Project I Bayesian application in fiber direction estimation using in-vivo Neuroimaging signal (Aug 2019 - Present at UNLV, USA)</b>
								<br>We applied Bayesian methodology and MCMC technique to estimate the fiber Direction within corpus 
								callosum using DT-MRI signals. We developed a methodology to resolve fiber crossing problem by collecting 
								neighbourhood information, processing them for each voxel and using them as prior to have a coherent model.
